## Overview

This is a curated index of array problems grouped by the pattern/technique they use. Start with Easy problems to learn the pattern, then progress to Medium and Hard.

**How to use this list:**
1. Learn a technique (e.g., Two Pointers) from the techniques folder
2. Solve the Easy problems for that pattern
3. Move to Medium problems
4. Attempt Hard problems only after mastering the pattern
