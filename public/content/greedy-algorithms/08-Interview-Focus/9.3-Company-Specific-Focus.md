# Company-Specific Greedy Focus

> **What each major company emphasizes in greedy interviews**

---

## 🏢 Amazon

### Interview Style
- Focus on **practical problem-solving**
- Values **clear communication** of approach
- Expects **working code** (less emphasis on proofs)
- Often asks **classic interval problems**

### Most Common Problems

| Problem | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Merge Intervals | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Must know perfectly |
| Meeting Rooms II | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Very common |
| Task Scheduler | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Common in SDE2+ |
| Jump Game | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Classic greedy |
| Gas Station | ⭐⭐⭐ | Tests circular thinking |

### Amazon Tips

1. **Explain your approach first** - Don't jump into code
2. **Think about edge cases** - Empty inputs, single elements
3. **Optimize for readability** - Clean code matters
4. **Relate to real-world** - "Like scheduling delivery routes"

### Sample Dialogue

```
Interviewer: "Design a meeting room scheduler"

You: "So we need to find the minimum number of rooms needed 
for all meetings. I'll sort meetings by start time and use 
a min-heap to track when rooms free up. This gives O(n log n) 
time and O(n) space for the heap."
```

## 🔵 Google

### Interview Style
- May ask for **proof of correctness**
- Expects **optimal solution**
- Often combines patterns
- Tests **edge case thinking** deeply

### Most Common Problems

| Problem | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Jump Game II | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Optimal solution expected |
| Candy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Two-pass reasoning |
| Course Schedule III | ⭐⭐⭐ | Heap + greedy |
| Minimum Arrows | ⭐⭐⭐ | Interval counting |
| Partition Labels | ⭐⭐⭐ | Last occurrence |

### Google Tips

1. **Be ready to prove correctness** - Exchange argument
2. **Optimize before coding** - O(n) if possible
3. **Discuss trade-offs** - Time vs space
4. **Handle follow-ups** - "What if input is streaming?"

### Sample Dialogue

```
Interviewer: "Why is your greedy approach optimal?"

You: "At each step, we make the locally optimal choice of 
[X]. This is globally optimal because any alternative choice 
can be swapped with ours without improving the result - 
an exchange argument. Specifically, if we chose [Y] instead, 
we could always swap to [X] since [reason]."
```

## 🔷 Meta (Facebook)

### Interview Style
- Emphasizes **bug-free coding**
- Tests **code execution** (fewer syntax errors)
- Values **quick problem-solving**
- Often has **45-minute slots** (less time)

### Most Common Problems

| Problem | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Merge Intervals | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Standard problem |
| Insert Interval | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Variation |
| Non-overlapping | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Sort by end |
| Task Scheduler | ⭐⭐⭐ | Common |
| Two City Scheduling | ⭐⭐⭐ | Optimization |

### Meta Tips

1. **Write clean, bug-free code** - They run your code
2. **Think about types** - Python: list vs set vs dict
3. **Test before submitting** - Trace through example
4. **Be concise** - Less time for discussion

### Sample Dialogue

```
Interviewer: "Merge overlapping intervals"

You: "I'll sort by start time, then iterate and merge if 
current start <= previous end. Let me code this..."

[Write code, then:]

"Let me verify with example [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10]]...
After sorting: same. Merge (1,3) and (2,6) → (1,6).
(8,10) doesn't overlap. Result: [[1,6],[8,10]]."
```

## 🟢 Microsoft

### Interview Style
- Balanced approach - **code + explanation**
- Values **structured problem-solving**
- May ask **simpler problems** with **follow-ups**
- Tests **communication skills**

### Most Common Problems

| Problem | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Merge Intervals | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Standard |
| Jump Game | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Classic |
| Assign Cookies | ⭐⭐⭐ | Easy warm-up |
| Gas Station | ⭐⭐⭐ | Medium difficulty |
| Lemonade Change | ⭐⭐ | Easy simulation |

### Microsoft Tips

1. **Think out loud** - They want to see your process
2. **Start with brute force** - Then optimize
3. **Ask clarifying questions** - Show thoroughness
4. **Consider maintainability** - Code quality matters

### Sample Dialogue

```
You: "Let me start with a brute force approach first.
I could check every possible subarray, which is O(n²).
But I notice we can do better with greedy because 
[reason]. This brings it down to O(n) time."
```
