## 💡 Study Tips

### Effective Practice

1. **Time yourself** - Use a timer for each problem
2. **Don't look at hints** - Struggle for 20 min before peeking
3. **Trace by hand** - Draw bits on paper for complex operations
4. **Explain out loud** - Practice the communication aspect
5. **Review mistakes** - Keep a log of bugs you made

### When Stuck

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Stuck on problem] --> B{Tried 20 min?}
    B -->|No| C[Keep trying]
    B -->|Yes| D{Understand the pattern?}
    D -->|No| E[Read the relevant .md file]
    D -->|Yes| F[Look at one hint]
    E --> G[Try again]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Solved?}
    H -->|No| I[See solution, understand why]
    H -->|Yes| J[Add to review list]
    I --> K[Re-solve tomorrow without help]
```

### Building Intuition

- **Binary visualization:** Write out bits for every operation
- **Pattern recognition:** Notice when XOR, masks, or n-1 tricks apply
- **Mental math:** Practice small conversions (13 = 1101, etc.)
