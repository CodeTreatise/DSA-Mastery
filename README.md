## 📖 How It Works

### 1. **Learn Patterns** 
Instead of memorizing individual problems, master reusable patterns:
- Two Pointers for sorted arrays
- Sliding Window for subarray problems
- DFS/BFS for tree & graph problems
- DP for optimization problems

### 2. **Practice Strategically**
- Start with Easy problems to learn the pattern
- Move to Medium problems to apply it
- Tackle Hard problems for edge cases
- Use the spaced repetition schedule

### 3. **Track Progress**
- Mark concepts complete as you learn them
- Track problems solved by difficulty
- Watch your streak grow on the heatmap
- See which companies/topics you're ready for

### 4. **Prepare for Interviews**
- Company-specific problem lists
- Interview communication tips
- Mock interview practice
- Last-minute cheatsheets

## 🎯 Interview Success Stories

Based on analysis of real interviews:

| Pattern | % of Problems | Priority |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Two Pointers + DFS/BFS | ~50% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Sliding Window + Binary Search | ~30% | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| DP + Greedy | ~15% | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Advanced (Trie, Union-Find) | ~5% | ⭐⭐ |

**Key insight:** Mastering just Two Pointers + DFS/BFS covers **HALF** of all interview problems!
